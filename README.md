# Cyberdrill-Simulation-Scripts

The PowerShell scripts are intended for use in cyber drill exercises to generate alerts for testing and evaluating security solutions. 
These scripts should only be used in a controlled environment, as they can have a real impact on systems.
I will not be held responsible for any misuse or unintended consequences resulting from the use of these scripts.
